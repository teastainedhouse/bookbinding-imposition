# Bookbinding Imposition
*FOSS for hobbyist bookbinders to impose PDFs for printing signatures*

## Notes for folio printing

For best results make sure:
- Every page is the same size.
- The page size is the same height as the paper you wish to print to and *half* the width.

### Handy page size chart for folio printing

| Desired Output            | Recommended Start    |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| ( **Height** x Width)     | (Width x **Height**) |
| Letter (8.5" x 11")       | 5.5" x 8.5"          |
| Legal (8.5" x 14")        | 7" x 8.5"            |
| Tabloid (11" x 17")       | 8.5" x 11"           |
| Tabloid Extra (12" x 18") | 9" x 12"             |
| Super B (13" x 19")       | 9.5" x 13"           |

### Recommended Workflow

1. Create (or download) the original PDF with the correct page sizes.
   1. or use the size as-is, i.e. if the start PDF is alerady designed in letter size and you then run it through 
      the imposer you'll have larger margins but it'll still work fine.
2. Run PDF through this imposer
3. User a PDF viewer that has duplex printing settings (Adobe Acrobat or similar) and use the "flip on short edge" 
   setting.
